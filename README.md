# 🏐 Volleyball Nations League 2023: Data Exploration with Python  

## 📌 Overview  
This project dives into **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **2023 Volleyball Nations League dataset**, uncovering key trends in team performance, match dynamics, and scoring patterns. Using Python, I analyzed match statistics to provide insights that can help teams, analysts, and sports enthusiasts better understand the competition.  This was part of a follow-along project on this tutorial ([YouTube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6O0KWcg4Eg&list=PLTsu3dft3CWhLHbHTTzvG3Vx8XDWemG17&index=2))

With a data-driven approach, this project explores:  
- **Which positions are most common in professional volleyball?** 🏆  
- **Which teams and players dominate in attack and defence?** 🔥  
- **What is the ideal age range for peak volleyball performance?** ⏳

## 🎯 Project Highlights  

### 📊 **Insights from the Dataset**  

### 🏆 What was the distribution of positions?  
- **Insight**: The two most common positions in the league were **Outside Hitter (OH) and Middle Blocker (MB)**, making up **56.5% of all players**.  
- **Takeaway**: These positions are crucial for both **offensive and defensive strategies**, indicating that teams prioritize strong outside hitters and middle blockers for balanced gameplay.  

### 📈 Which country had the best attack on average?  
- **Insight**: **France** had the highest average attack performance.  
- **Takeaway**: France's strong attacking efficiency suggests they focus on **high-powered offensive plays**, which is a key factor in their overall success.  

### 🏠 Which position in which country had the best attack?  
- **Insight**: The **Outside Hitter (OH) from Japan** had the highest attack efficiency.  
- **Takeaway**: Japan’s reliance on **OH players for offensive output** highlights their strategy of **fast-paced, technically skilled attacks** rather than pure power.  

### 🛡️ What was the age distribution?  
- **Insight**: Most players were between the ages of **24 and 31**.  
- **Takeaway**: This age range suggests that peak performance in professional volleyball **typically occurs in the mid-to-late 20s**, when players have both **experience and physical endurance**.  

### 🔢 Which position has the best attack?  
- **Insight**: **Opposite (OP) hitters** had the highest attack efficiency.  
- **Takeaway**: Opposites are **primary attackers** in modern volleyball, proving that **strong offensive players in this role can significantly impact a team's scoring ability**.  

### 🏐 Which country had the best total block and attack?  
- **Insight**: **France** led in both **blocking and attacking**.  
- **Takeaway**: A combination of **strong offensive and defensive play** makes France a dominant team, showing that balanced performance across **both skills** is key to success.
